# b0x
This is a collection of my personal preferences and tools. Similar to people's personal dot file repositories. Though since it is just for me, can't guarantee it is the prettiest.
## Install
For initial setup, run the following command
```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlively/b0x/master/b0x/install.sh)
```
If any files already exist, they will be moved to **.b0x-backup**. Basically this is using a [bare git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) to avoid getting everything in the home directory.
There are more scripts in the **b0x** directory to do further installation.
